# Bitcoin Addresses

**Play-by-play:** [CLI Demo -- Update](http://showterm.io/d00ae10bb8c6a0175ead5)

Given a private key (encoded in hex), this tool generates a public bitcoin address.
Similar in functionality to the address page in the [bitcore playground](https://bitcore.io/playground/#/address)

## Generating a Bitcoin Address
A bitcoin address is more or less an encoded hash of the public key associated with your private key, which is itself just a large random number.

1. Generate a private key (a large random number) in the [bitcore playground](https://bitcore.io/playground/#/address).
2. Pass the private key to the script
3. Use the --c or --u flags to see the two _different_ (compressed vs. uncompressed) addresses that can be created using the same private key

```
$ python address.py --secret 'e1e78ca3ebbce24977ddd8161905e7ee6821c0a100a6c1a58ac2e0cf79f98635'
Bitcoin Address (Compressed): 13bPizZnaT1KrVpuce54m4pfrr6qP4Ykk2
```

Compressed public keys are generated by default. Here's how to generate a bitcoin address using an uncompressed public key:
```
$ python address.py --secret 'e1e78ca3ebbce24977ddd8161905e7ee6821c0a100a6c1a58ac2e0cf79f98635' --u
Bitcoin Address (Uncompressed): 1F7JmVptgKkvLqdjhj4DTX35Uqh8APrfc
```

Prior to Bitcoin Core 0.6 uncompressed public keys were used. **Compressed public keys** are now the recommended default because they significantly reduce the space used to store public keys for every spent output.
